"""BeaPro Automation Outline

This is the main automation file that orchestrates the bot execution flow.
It handles initialization, item processing, exception handling, and finalization.

To customize your automation:
- Adjust initialization settings in framework/initialize.py
- Add your automation steps in the process_item() function located in framework/process.py
- Configure your data source in framework/datasources.py

The BeaPro framework automatically handles:
- System exceptions (technical failures with restart capability)
- Interruption requests from BotCity Orchestrator
- Success/error reporting and alerting
- Logging, and more. Check the README.md for more information.
